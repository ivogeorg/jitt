A framework for Just-in-Time Teaching

## Design

1. [Design spike 1](design-spike-1.md) is a first stab at the data schema and main user stories.  
2. [Design spike 2](design-spike-2.md) is a design iteration after the incorporation of additional specifications from Jeff.  
3. [Design spike 3](design-spike-3.md) resolved major features of questions, question banks, and assignment building.  
4. [Design spike 4](design-spike-4.md) is current:
   1. User stories drafted.  
   2. Views enumerated.  
   3. A few major views described. 
   4. Redefined _"question bank"_ to list, in the sense that there is no bank object but instead questions can be assigned extra metadata for association into _lists_ (like Google Photo albums).  
   5. Large task is to figure out working with [question lists](https://github.com/ivogeorg/jitt/blob/main/design-spike-4.md#instructor-question-list) and how functionality flows between question lists and question design.
