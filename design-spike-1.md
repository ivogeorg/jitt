# Design spike 1 for [jiit](https://github.com/ivogeorg/jitt)

**Date:** 2021-01-15

## 1. Instructor stories

1. I want to ask my students a small number of _warmup questions_ before every class period.
2. Answering the questions shouldn't take a student more than 25 minutes.  
3. I went to be able to quickly review the answers, possibly group them, and select some as discussion triggers for class.  
4. I want to be able to load up questions for the class periods for a whole semester, and have the flexibility to adjust to the way the specific class is moving through the material.  

## 2. Instructor data

1. (GUID) ID.  
2. Name. _Need to have a disambiguation mechanism._
3. (GUID) Employer school ID.  
4. (UID per "Employer school ID") Employer department.  
5. (set) Classes.

## 3. Course data

1. Catalog identifier.  
2. (GUID) Offering school ID.  
3. (UID per "Offering school ID") Offering department.  
4.
